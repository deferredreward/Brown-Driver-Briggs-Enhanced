# Brown-Driver-Briggs-Enhanced

The Brown-Driver-Briggs Lexicon of the Hebrew Bible is in the public domain. The current datasets improves upon an existing dataset by explicitly marking the boundaries of different senses and stems. It also takes the first steps to encode the implicit typographical information (such as bold and italics) into the pragmatic categories they represent (such as primary and secondary glosses).

The base data for this repository was taken from https://github.com/eliranwong/unabridged-BDB-Hebrew-lexicon. The data was transformed into individual HTML files for the sake of quality assurance. A color scheme that hurts the eyes was added for that same reason. Feel free to tweak it.


## Contents

- The `Placeholders` directory contains the image files for ancient languages other than Hebrew and Aramaic. These images have yet to be transcribed (not transliterated) into actual unicode text.
- The `Entries` directory contains the individual BDB entries, one entry per file. The choice for HTML as an initial format it to make it easy for anyone to open, especially for quality assurance purposes.


## License

As mentioned above, the lexicon is in the public domain. All changes and additions to the lexicon are released under a CC BY license. If you use this dataset, please provide a link to this repository.

## Contributors

The following contributors have worked on enhancing the dataset:

- Joel Ruark
- J. de Joode

- Stephen Ku
- Eliran Wong

New contributions are welcomed and encouraged. Please try to be systematic in your enhancements.

If you are interested in contributing, the roadmap for this dataset could include things like: a) transcriptions of the placeholders, b) verified internal crosslinks, both within articles and across articles, c) the creation of a glossary based on the tags, etc.
